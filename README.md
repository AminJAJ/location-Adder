# location-Adder

Location Adder is an application that can add the (x, y) coordinates of buildings into an SQL database. Users have to highlight the buildings, add a name to that building. The app will automatically add those info into a database.

The app was created for an application we were building called "get_to_class". We were attemting to create an indoor navigation system for our university campus. 

My part was to create an application which can directly add the (x, y) coordinates of buildings into a table just by heighlighting them on the map. 

The data on the table will be used to first specify the names of all the buildings on the map. The data will also be used to get the shortest path between two buildings using an a* algorithim
